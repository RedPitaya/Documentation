Linien - User-friendly locking of lasers (Humboldt University)
************************************************************************

User-friendly locking of lasers using RedPitaya (STEMlab 125-14) that just works. Linien aims to follow the UNIX philosophy of doing a single 
thing (locking using intelligent algorithms) very well. It was mainly developed for locking spectroscopy signals but may also be used for 
Pound-Drever-Hall or other lock-in techniques as well as simple PID operation. Linien is built with Python and Migen and is based on red pid.
