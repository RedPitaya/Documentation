Quick start
##############

This section will guide you through setting up and connecting to your Red Pitaya board for the first time. Whether you're a new user or experienced developer, you'll find step-by-step instructions for:

* **Board Identification** - Determine which Red Pitaya model you have
* **Requirements** - What you need to get started (power supply, SD card, cables)
* **First Connection** - Connect your board and access the web interface
* **OS Updates** - Keep your Red Pitaya software up to date
* **SD Card Management** - Prepare, backup, and manage your SD cards
* **Hardware Add-ons** - Install protective cases, heatsinks, and extension boards
* **Troubleshooting** - Solve common connection and setup issues

Most users should start with the :ref:`Board Identification Guide <ID_guide>`, followed by :ref:`What do I need before I start? <BeforeStart>`, and then :ref:`Connect to Red Pitaya <quickstart_connect>`.
