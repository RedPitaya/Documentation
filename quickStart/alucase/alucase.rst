Red Pitaya Aluminium Case Assembly
##################################

Whether you bought your Red Pitaya aluminium case in a kit or as a separate add-on, you will need to assemble it by hand.


Components
============

    Components of the Red Pitaya aluminium case.
    
Contents:

    * 4 screws to close the case and hold the board in place
    * 4 rubber feet for secure positioning on the desk
    * A thermal pad (barely visible in the photo)
    * A transparent plastic rod that directs the light of a red LED (Ready/CPU activity) to the top of the case.

   The inside of the Red Pitaya aluminium case.
    
* On the inside, there is a block in the upper part of the case (on the right in the picture above) that dissipates heat to the case. So the whole case acts as a heat sink.
* On the bottom of the case, there are openings for some air vents (left in the picture above).
* The openings in the case expose the connections to the expansion ports :ref:`E1 <E1_orig_gen>` and :ref:`E2 <E2_orig_gen>`.

Compatibility
==================

The aluminium case is compatible with the following Red Pitaya boards and their variations:

* STEMlab 125-14.
* SDRlab 122-16.
* STEMlab 125-14 4-Input.
* STEMlab 125-10.

Assembly Instructions
=======================

#. Remove the small plastic feet by pressing on the clips at the top with a small pair of pliers and pushing the feet down.

#. Repeat the procedure for the STEMlab 125-14 with the heat sink, pressing the clips together at the bottom and gently pushing the holder upwards.
   
#. The heat sink of the STEMlab 125-10 is glued to the FPGA. Turn the heatsink slightly, as shown in the picture below, until it comes loose.

        The top of the Red Pitaya board with the heat sink removed.

#. Remove the rest of the thermal compound.

#. Apply the thermal pad to the CPU.

#. Place the Red Pitaya board in the lower part of the case.

#. Turn the top of the case upside down and place the light guide plastic in place.

#. Close it with the bottom part of the case, including the Red Pitaya board. Make sure the holes in the board and the housing are aligned.

#. Replace the four screws.

#. Replace the rubber feet.
